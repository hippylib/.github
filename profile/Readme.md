# hIPPYlib Organization

This GitHub organization contains software projects related to state-of-the-art scalable adjoint-based algorithms for PDE-based deterministic and Bayesian inverse problems, optimization under uncertainty with PDE-constraints, and optimal design of experiments.

Key software projects:

- [hIPPYlib](github.com/hippylib/hippylib): PDE-based deterministic and Bayesian inverse problems. hIPPYlib uses [FEniCS](fenicsproject.org) for the discretization of the PDE and [PETSc](petsc.org) for parallel linear algebra
- [soupy](github.com/hippylib/soupy): optimization under uncertainty with PDE-constraints
- [hIPPYlib2muq](github.com/hippylib/hippylib2muq): An interface between hIPPYlib and [muq](muq.mit.edu/) to explore advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.
